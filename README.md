#IDEAS
- Tagging system
    - PROS
        - If strict and treated as strict things then it would be ok.
    - CONS
        - messy or disregard would be bad.
        - Translations of each tag?
        - Adaptable to use of each market.
    - Questions
        - how well does sugar handle it?
- Category system
    - PROS
        - what I currently have
        - less docs
        - More definite
        - maybe easier to translate? maybe?
    - CONS
        - docs only in one place

##UI Designs
- Category on top but always shown (it's current function).
- *Favorites of documents.*
- Category on the side.
- Category on top but hidden in search.
- Quick search on side for "power users"

#TODO
- Test with all major browsers and low powered devices.
- Integrate with Modx.
- Need to have people look over code for bugs and such.
- More usability tests.
- Add any features such as sorting or drop down filtering.
- Review with David as soon as possible.
- Figure out the exact json for api.
- Test with more files.
